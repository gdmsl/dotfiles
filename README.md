dotfiles
========

##Installation
After cloning this repository, for example in ~/dotfiles dir, use dotfiles.sh
or lndotfiles.sh to copy or link config files in your home directly. I
suggest to use the lndotfiles.sh script.

##Vim installation
To install all boundles in vim using voundle automatically please run the
script viminstall.sh located in ~/.local/bin/

##ZSH
I use zsh with the standard grml-zsh-config from archlinux repos.

##i3
My i3 config automatically execute nm-applet pa-applet and clipit so make sure
you have them installed.
